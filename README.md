## Project Description

The goals of this assignment are:

* To work with the object oriented version of our corpus code.
* To make a web app (!) that we can use to analyze text data.

Here, **in order**, are the steps you should do to successfully complete this project:

1. From moodle, accept the assignment. Open and set up a code space (install a python kernel and select it).
2. I wrote the comments; you write the code! Modify `spacy_on_corpus.py` following the instructions in this notebook.
3. Complete the notebook and commit it to Github. Make sure to commit the notebook in a "run" state!
4. Edit the README.md file. Provide your name, your class year, links to/descriptions of any extensions and a list of resources. 
5. Commit your code often. We will take the last commit before the deadline as your submission of the project.

Possible extensions (from least points to most points):

* Modify the token, entity, and noun chunk get count methods so they count only lower cased tokens, entities and noun chunks.
* Modify the [styling](https://anvil.works/learn/tutorials/using-material-3) of the web app. 
* To the screen `Build Corpus` in the web app, add the ability for the user to choose the language of their input documents.
* To the screen `Analyze Document` in the web app, add the ability for the user to choose a value for `top_k` and to choose which token and entity tags to exclude.
* Plot more than one analysis at a time in `Analyze Corpus` (see [this page](https://anvil.works/docs/client/components/plots)).
* Add the ability for a user to enter jsonl in the input text area on the `Build Corpus` screen.
* If you added paragraphs to project 3c, port that over to project 4a.
* Add some metadata analysis and visualization on a fourth screen.
* Your other ideas are welcome! If you'd like to discuss one with Dr Stent, feel free.
